This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue with percentage units in CSS.  Specifically, when setting `width` and `height` as percentages on an element whose parent does not have explicitly defined dimensions, the layout can be unexpected and inconsistent across browsers. The `bug.css` file contains the problematic CSS. The `bugSolution.css` file provides solutions to address this inconsistency.
