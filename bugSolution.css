Several approaches can solve the problem:

1. **Set explicit dimensions on the parent:** The most straightforward solution is to define explicit `width` and `height` for the parent element.  This establishes a clear reference for the percentage calculations.

```css
div.parent {
  width: 800px;
  height: 600px;
}
div.child {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
}
```

2. **Use viewport units:**  If you want the element's dimensions to be relative to the viewport, use `vw` (viewport width) and `vh` (viewport height) units.

```css
div {
  width: 50vw;
  height: 50vh;
}
```

3. **Set `box-sizing` to `border-box`:**  If you're using padding or border, make sure to set `box-sizing: border-box;` on the parent to ensure that padding and border are included in the total width and height calculations.  This prevents unexpected shrinking of the content area.

```css
div.parent {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 800px;
  height: 600px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 10px solid #ccc;
}
div.child {
  width: 50%;
  height: 50%;
}
```

Choose the solution most appropriate for your layout's needs.  The `bugSolution.css` file provides examples of these solutions.
